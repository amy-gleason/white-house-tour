               Great idea! The Oval Office details section is quite long. Let's split it into two manageable sections.
Step-by-Step to Split the Oval Office Details
Step 1: Find the Current Section
Look for this section:
javascript
{ icon: "üèõÔ∏è", title: "OVAL OFFICE - DETAILS", content: `...` }
Step 2: Decide How to Split It
Looking at your content, I'd suggest splitting it like this:
Part 1 - Room Features:
Presidential coat of arms
Gold leaf walls/ceiling
Italian stars in ceiling
Diet Coke button
Private dining room door
Part 2 - Artifacts & Fun Facts:
World Cup trophy
Air Force One model
Clock with IIII
Declaration of Independence
Door wallpaper trick
Military flags story
Eagle weight question
Step 3: Replace the Current Section with Two New Ones
Remove the current long section and replace it with these two:

                <li>"The presidential coat of arms was updated by Truman in 1956 to show the eagle facing the olive branch ‚Äî a symbol of peace."</li>
                
                <li>"The gold leaf on the walls and in the ceiling and the $100,000 upgrade was added during Trump's presidency ‚Äî it replaced a simple white inlay."</li>
                
                <li>"In the ceiling, do you notice anything funny looking about the stars?" - Answer - "The stars are Italian stars and nobody noticed that they had too many points until it was finished. They thought they would just fix it on the next renovation, but you have to remove the ceiling to fix it so it has stayed."</li>
                
                <li>"There is a box with a button by the phone - each President can program it to what they want to receive. Some choose coffee, but President Trump has it call for Diet Coke."</li>
                
                <li>"The door to the right leads to the private dining room ‚Äî famously tied to the Monica Lewinsky story."</li>

                <li>"Behind the curtain is a rare copy of the Declaration of Independence, added by Trump. It's kept behind the curtain to protect it from light. It is the third copy and the original is in the National Archives"</li>
                
                <li>"The back of the door looks like the same wallpaper as the walls to make it look like the rest of the walls when the door is closed."</li>
                
                <li>"Trump used to drag the military flags in here from the Roosevelt Room for pictures ‚Äî eventually they made replicas just for him to use in the Oval. We will talk more about those flags when we get to the Roosevelt Room."</li>
                
                <li>Outside the Oval, look up and ask, "Guess how much that eagle weighs?" - wait for answers and don't answer any probing questions. Answer - "It weighs about two pounds. Nancy Reagan was afraid that the original heavy one would fall on someone, so she had it replaced with this one that is made of lightweight wood and painted gold."</li>
