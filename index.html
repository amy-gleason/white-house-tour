                                    <li>"Presidents can customize pretty much all of the room ‚Äî but three things are fixed: the American flag must be there, there must be a portrait of George Washington, and the desk must face away from the window to show that the leader of the free world isn't afraid to have his back to the window"</li>

The HMS Resolute was a British naval ship that became icebound in the Arctic. American whalers discovered and salvaged the ship, and the U.S. restored and returned it to Britain as a gesture of goodwill. In appreciation, Queen Victoria had the desk made from its timbers and sent it to the United States."</li>
