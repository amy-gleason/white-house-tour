                                    <li>"It was first made to be in the Oval shape by Taft in 1909. It was modeled after the Blue Room in the East Wing because Taft thought it would help with room flow."</li>
                                    <li>"Presidents can customize pretty much all of the room — but three things are fixed: the American flag must be there, there must be a portrait of George Washington, and the desk must face away from the window to show that the leader of the free world isn't afraid to have his back to the window"</li>
                                    <li>"The rest of the room from the carpet, curtains, paintings, furniture - pretty much everything else can be changed by the president. The rug in here is Reagan's rug."</li>

                                    <li>"The Resolute Desk, used by eight presidents, was a gift from Queen Victoria in 1880. The HMS Resolute was a British naval ship that became icebound in the Arctic. American whalers discovered and salvaged the ship, and the U.S. restored and returned it to Britain as a gesture of goodwill. In appreciation, Queen Victoria had the desk made from its timbers and sent it to the United States."</li>
                                    <li>"There's a nearly identical twin desk made from the same ship — it's in Buckingham Palace."</li>
                                    <li>"JFK was the first to use it in the Oval Office in 1961 and most presidents have used it since then. Before it was in the Oval Office, it was used in other parts of the White House."</li>
