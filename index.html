                                    <li>"This is the working office of the President."</li>
                                    <li>"It was first made to be in the Oval shape by Taft in 1909. It was modeled after the Blue Room in the East Wing because Taft thought it would help with room flow."</li>
                                    <li>"Presidents can customize pretty much all of the room ‚Äî but three things are fixed: the American flag must be there, there must be a portrait of George Washington, and the desk must face away from the window to show that the leader of the free world isn't afraid to have his back to the window"</li>
                                    <li>"The rest of the room from the carpet, curtains, paintings, furniture - pretty much everything else can be changed by the president. The rug in here is Reagan's rug."</li>

                                    <li>"The Resolute Desk, used by eight presidents, was a gift from Queen Victoria in 1880. The HMS Resolute was a British naval ship that became icebound in the Arctic. American whalers discovered and salvaged the ship, and the U.S. restored and returned it to Britain as a gesture of goodwill. In appreciation, Queen Victoria had the desk made from its timbers and sent it to the United States."</li>
                                    <li>"There's a nearly identical twin desk made from the same ship ‚Äî it's in Buckingham Palace."</li>
                                    <li>"JFK was the first to use it in the Oval Office in 1961 and most presidents have used it since then. Before it was in the Oval Office, it was also used by other presidents in the residence or Eisenhower building"</li>
                                    <li>"There are many iconic pictures of the Resolute desk but the one with JFK's kids playing around the desk is one of the most well known."</li>
                                    <li>"FDR had the front of the desk closed in because he didn't want his wheelchair to be seen as he thought it made him appear weak."</li>

                                    <li>"The presidential coat of arms was updated by Truman in 1956 to show the eagle facing the olive branch ‚Äî a symbol of peace."</li>
                                    <li>"The gold leaf on the walls and in the ceiling and the $100,000 upgrade was added during Trump's presidency ‚Äî it replaced a simple white inlay."</li>
                                    <li>"In the ceiling, do you notice anything funny looking about the stars?" - Answer - "The stars are Italian stars and nobody noticed that they had too many points until it was finished. They thought they would just fix it on the next renovation, but you have to remove the ceiling to fix it so it has stayed."</li>
                                    <li>"There is a box with a button by the phone - each President can program it to what they want to receive. Some choose coffee, but President Trump has it call for Diet Coke."</li>

                                    <li>"The clock on the mantel uses 'IIII' instead of 'IV' ‚Äî this was something early Americans did to show their independence and to rebel from the roman numeral IV and show it as IIII."</li>
                                    <li>"Behind the curtain is a rare copy of the Declaration of Independence, added by Trump. It's kept behind the curtain to protect it from light. It is the third copy and the original is in the National Archives"</li>
                                    <li>"The back of the door looks like the same wallpaper as the walls to make it look like the rest of the walls when the door is closed."</li>
                                    <li>"Trump used to drag the military flags in here from the Roosevelt Room for pictures ‚Äî eventually they made replicas just for him to use in the Oval. We will talk more about those flags when we get to the Roosevelt Room."</li>

Nancy Reagan was afraid that the original heavy one would fall on someone, so she had it replaced with this one that is made of lightweight wood and painted gold."</li>
